## Instruction
### 1. clone repository to u local
#### 2. open as project using idea
#### 3. open postman collection, click on button at the end of the file          
#### 4. run application
#### 5. execute postman collections queries one by one. Care, last query(http://localhost:8080/article/save) need Bearer token, if it does not exist u can take it from  query(http://localhost:8080/auth) before last. By the way token has inserted to query. I hope.
